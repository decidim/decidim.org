## Release Highlights

The major highlight of this version is a technical one: the upgrade to Rails 7.2. But as always, over the six months between releases we’ve had time to add plenty of improvements, including two new components that revisit and refine previous experiments: the new Elections component and the Collaborative Texts component.

### **Elections**

After exploring different hypotheses around potential voting mechanisms (with and without cryptographic guarantees), we have finally implemented a component based on the concrete needs of organizations requiring these kinds of processes. This component makes it possible to run elections with multiple configuration options, without the complexity introduced by a cryptographic layer.

For elections that do require additional guarantees, there is a community module integrating the Vocdoni protocol. In the future, our goal is to converge toward a single module that can optionally enable the Vocdoni security layer.

### **Collaborative texts**

This is the first iteration of a new component designed to replace the old Participatory Texts, which is currently tied to the Proposals component and comes with several usability issues. Instead of extracting the existing functionality into a new module, we chose to rebuild it from scratch, informed by years of accumulated experience and diverse use cases.

The plan is to add a couple more iterations to cover all required functionalities and then deprecate the old Participatory Texts, helping to simplify and lighten the Proposals component.

## Improvements to Existing Features

### **API**

This release brings substantial updates to the API, strengthening both functionality and reliability. We introduced configurable API authentication to enforce secure access and expanded the Write API with new capabilities, including action logging and support for answering proposals. The GraphQL API has been updated and refined, with several resource fields revised for greater consistency. We’ve also standardized timestamp formats to ensure better interoperability across systems. Finally, we added documentation and examples for integrating Decidim with Grafana, making it easier to monitor and visualize platform activity.

### **Admin panel**

We continue to make improvements to the administration panel. This time, we focused on reorganizing the collections of action icons, which in some cases had become unsustainable, and implemented a dropdown menu to ensure better scalability. As always, this is just the first iteration! In the next release, we plan to refine this solution so that each table keeps a couple of the most frequently used actions visible. We also continued streamlining forms and bringing order to the interface by moving configuration options into the content blocks where they belong.
