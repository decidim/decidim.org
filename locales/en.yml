    section-2:
      paragraph: '<h3>a. Data collected from surfing the Website</h3> <p>When using our website, <a href="%{decidim_url}">Decidim</a> uses the services of Plausible analysis software.  Its is software that, when tracking user data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track general traffic trends on your website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address and user agent to the server, so that''s what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the visitor''s IP address and user agent. To anonymise this data, it is passed through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate the number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the user agent are never stored in the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.   In this way, no personal user data is collected while browsing our website, for more information about the data processing by Plausible Analytics, you can visit their website at <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics</a></p> <h3>b.

      org: Barcelona City Hall (2015-2019)
      quote: Thanks to Decidim, in Barcelona we have managed to co-produce a strategic city plan together with the citizens. In 2016 we inaugurated the Municipal Action Plan in the form of a participatory process through Decidim Barcelona. Currently, this plan includes almost 7 thousand citizen proposals. One of the advantages of using this platform is that you can monitor at all times the state of implementation of the approved proposals.
    n2:
      org: Som Energia
      quote: With the implementation of Decidim in Som Energia we have generated a kinder space for participation. We released the tool in 2018, hosting the General Assembly of the Cooperative and months later we debated the Image Redesign and collaborative development of the School of Som Energia, among other participatory processes. In a few months, more than 3,500 participant people have registered, 5 participatory processes, 3 assemblies operating and more than 1,300 votes in the last General Assembly vote.

      org: Municipal President of Mérida Yucatán, Mexico. City Council of Mérida Yucatán, Mexico
      quote: The Decide Mérida digital platform was an opportunity that opened as never before the mechanisms of citizen participation for the elaboration of the Municipal Development Plan of Mérida 2018-2021. We had more than 3,000 citizen interactions including proposals, comments, suggestions and support that achieving the highest consensus possible about what is best for our city. Undoubtedly, the Decide Mérida platform will continue to be our ally in making Mérida an increasingly participative society.

      org: City of Helsinki
      quote: What we appreciate is that it’s built with democracy in mind and therefore democracy is a big focus. Democratic principles such as accountability, equality and transparency are in the core of the design.

      org: Open Government of Mexico City
      quote: Almost every participatory process that has come to our table, we have been able to solve it using Decidim's business rules. As a tool, it is a very strong one. However, the part that seems strongest and most important to us is its community, both developers and those who use it for participatory processes. Coexisting with them has made us appreciate the challenges involved in implementing participatory democracy in the real world.
    n6:
      org: Mozilla Foundation
      quote: We suffer under a lack of public space. It's particularly important that we reclaim these public spaces for us. Open platforms such as Decidim do exactly that. Is not only that is open source so other people can fork it, reuse it and build a process. It also has these values that we want to reflect in our society encoded in the way it's designed.

      org: OpenForum Europe Research Director, European Union
      quote: The process started in October 2019 at the European Commission’s DG Communication and eDemocracy unit at the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's science and knowledge service. An analysis of the needs of the Conference and which tools fit those, lead to choosing the open source tool Decidim for its technical maturity, broad community and adaptability.
    n8:
      org: Pipeline to Power, working for NYC Civic Engagement Commission
      quote: Part of what makes Decidim so powerful is that it adds a level of abstraction to the work separating out  the steps of a process and the activities associated with the process. That’s part of the information architecture, so that not only you are saying what is happening at each step but different parts of Decidim behave differently depending on when you are doing or depending on what step in the process you are in. The fact that that’s customizable really allows Decidim to be moulded to how we are doing our work and not our work to be moulded.
