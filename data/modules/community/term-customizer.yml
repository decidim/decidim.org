  A Decidim module to customize the localized terms in the system. The module
  allows administrators to add "translation sets" through the admin panel which
  contain customized terms for any module in the system. These sets can be
  applied against different scopes within the system, e.g. the whole system,
  participatory space scope (e.g. all participatory processes or a specific
  participatory process) or a specific component within a participatory space.
