description: This module adds a configuration option in admin panel, enabling
  users to signin/signup to the platform, without going through the barriers of
  account creation process(for the case of signup) and normal flow of
  authentication through combination of username/email and password (for the
  case of signing in). Instead, users will receive an email/sms containing a
  verification code, by which they will be authorized and signed in/up. This
  feature aims at particularly easing the process of participation during voting
  phase. This feature is configurable in admin panel.
