description: Provides the possibility to add any objects (proposals, plans,
  projects, results, etc.) to user's personal favorites. This is a technical
  module that adds this ability to Decidim but the favorites functionality needs
  to be manually added to the individual models and the favorite buttons need to
  be added to the views.
