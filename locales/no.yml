      p3: To support recently incorporated organizations, Decidim Partners will be exempted from contributing economically during their first year to first develop their business plan with Decidim.

    section-2:
      paragraph: '<h3>a. Data collected from surfing the Website</h3> <p>When using our website, <a href="%{decidim_url}">Decidim</a> uses the services of Plausible analysis software.  Its is software that, when tracking user data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track general traffic trends on your website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address and user agent to the server, so that''s what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the visitor''s IP address and user agent. To anonymise this data, it is passed through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate the number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the user agent are never stored in the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.   In this way, no personal user data is collected while browsing our website, for more information about the data processing by Plausible Analytics, you can visit their website at <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics</a></p> <h3>b.

      quote: Takket være Decidim, i Barcelona har vi klart å medutarbeide en strategisk byplan sammen med borgerne. I 2016 innførte vi den kommunale handlingsplanen i form av en deltakende prosess gjennom Decidim Barcelona. Denne planen omfatter i dag nærmere 7 tusen forslag. En av fordelene ved å bruke denne plattformen er at du til enhver tid kan overvåke tilstanden til de godkjente forslagene.

      quote: Med implementeringen av dekidim i Som Energia har vi skapt et barnehagerom for deltakelse. Vi la ut verktøyet i 2018, vertskap for generalforsamlingen i samarbeidet, og månedene senere debatterte vi Image Redesign and collaborative development of the School of Som Energia, blant andre deltakende prosesser. I løpet av noen måneder har mer enn 3500 deltakere registrert seg, 5 deltakerprosesser, 3 avtaler som opererer med mer enn 1300 stemmer i forrige generalforsamling.

      quote: Nesten hver deltakerprosess som er kommet til vårt bord, har vi vært i stand til å løse den ved hjelp av Decidims forretningsregler. Som et verktøy er det et veldig sterkt virkemiddel. Den delen som fremstår som sterkest og viktigst for oss, er imidlertid fellesskapet, både de som utvikler og de som bruker det på deltakende prosesser. Samspillet med dem har gjort at vi setter pris på utfordringene med å gjennomføre deltakende demokrati i den virkelige verden.

      quote: We suffer under a lack of public space. It's particularly important that we reclaim these public spaces for us. Open platforms such as Decidim do exactly that. Is not only that is open source so other people can fork it, reuse it and build a process. It also has these values that we want to reflect in our society encoded in the way it's designed.

      quote: The process started in October 2019 at the European Commission’s DG Communication and eDemocracy unit at the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's science and knowledge service. An analysis of the needs of the Conference and which tools fit those, lead to choosing the open source tool Decidim for its technical maturity, broad community and adaptability.

      org: Pipeline to Power, working for NYC Civic Engagement Commission
      quote: Part of what makes Decidim so powerful is that it adds a level of abstraction to the work separating out  the steps of a process and the activities associated with the process. That’s part of the information architecture, so that not only you are saying what is happening at each step but different parts of Decidim behave differently depending on when you are doing or depending on what step in the process you are in. The fact that that’s customizable really allows Decidim to be moulded to how we are doing our work and not our work to be moulded.
