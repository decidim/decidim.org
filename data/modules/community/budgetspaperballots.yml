  This module allows an admin to import paper ballots in a participatory
  budgeting vote.


  The import process can be repeated as many times as desired, or done at once. It isn't possible to edit a value that was wrongly imported, but it is possible to import a negative number of votes to apply a correction.


  The number of paper votes for each project can then be seen in the admin panel and the aggregated number of votes for each project (both paper and online) can be seen on the frontend. These values are also made available in the various data exports (from the admin panel, the open data and the API).
