    explanation:
      p1: Sustaining Decidim takes time and resources. Several tasks need to be handled, such as reviewing contributions, triaging issues, fixing bugs, writing documentation, and answering general doubts shared by the community. Any organization (enterprise, association, or collective) willing to become a Decidim Partner is committed to contribute to the Decidim Association with a reduced fee of the 3% of the yearly income generated by Decidim activities. In the case of nonprofit organizations, this fee is 1.5%.

In addition, the Decidim Association will recommend Decidim Partners in our talks and email conversations about providing services with Decidim.
      p3: To support recently incorporated organizations, Decidim Partners will be exempted from contributing economically during their first year to first develop their business plan with Decidim. In the meantime, we recommend that Decidim Partners find other ways to contribute to the project (such as with bug reporting, documentation, participation and support in community activities, etc.).

      paragraph: '<h3>a. Data collected from surfing the Website</h3> <p>When using our website, <a href="%{decidim_url}">Decidim</a> uses the services of Plausible analysis software.  Its is software that, when tracking user data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track general traffic trends on your website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address and user agent to the server, so that''s what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the visitor''s IP address and user agent. To anonymise this data, it is passed through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate the number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the user agent are never stored in the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.   In this way, no personal user data is collected while browsing our website, for more information about the data processing by Plausible Analytics, you can visit their website at <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics</a></p> <h3>b.

This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.

Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li> <li><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li> </ul> <p>The aforementioned rights may be effective by contacting us at <a href="mailto:privacy@decidim.org">privacy@decidim.org</a>. <p>You also have the right to make any complaint to the competent authority, in this case the Spanish Data Protection Agency (Agencia Española de Protección de Datos), C/.

      org: Stadshuset i Barcelona (2015-2019)
      quote: Tack vare Decidim har vi i Barcelona tillsammans med medborgarna lyckats producera en strategisk stadsplan. Under 2016 invigde vi den kommunala handlingsplanen i form av en deltagande process genom Decidim Barcelona. För närvarande omfattar denna plan nästan 7 tusen förslag medborgare. En av fördelarna med att använda denna plattform är att man hela tiden kan övervaka genomförandet av de godkända förslagen.

      org: Som Energia
      quote: Med genomförandet av Decidim i Som Energia har vi genererat ett vänligare utrymme för deltagande. Vi släppte verktyget 2018, värd för generalförsamlingen av kooperativa och månader senare debatterade vi Image Redesign och samarbete utveckling av School of Som Energia, bland annat deltagande processer. På några månader har mer än 3500 deltagare anmält sig, 5 deltagarprocesser, 3 församlingar och mer än 1300 röster i den senaste generalförsamlingens omröstning.

Vi hade mer än 3000 medborgare interaktioner inklusive förslag, kommentarer, förslag och stöd för att uppnå högsta möjliga konsensus om vad som är bäst för vår stad. Utan tvekan kommer Decide Me<unk> rida plattformen fortsätta att vara vår bundsförvant för att göra Me<unk> rida till ett samhälle som blir alltmer delaktigt.

      quote: Nästan varje deltagarprocess som har kommit till vårt bord har vi kunnat lösa den med hjälp av Decidids affärsregler. Som ett verktyg är det en mycket stark sådan. Men den del som verkar starkast och viktigast för oss är dess gemenskap, både utvecklare och de som använder den för deltagandeprocesser. Samexistens med dem har fått oss att inse de utmaningar som är förknippade med genomförandet av deltagandedemokrati i verkligheten.

      quote: We suffer under a lack of public space. It's particularly important that we reclaim these public spaces for us. Open platforms such as Decidim do exactly that. Is not only that is open source so other people can fork it, reuse it and build a process. It also has these values that we want to reflect in our society encoded in the way it's designed.

      quote: The process started in October 2019 at the European Commission’s DG Communication and eDemocracy unit at the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's science and knowledge service. An analysis of the needs of the Conference and which tools fit those, lead to choosing the open source tool Decidim for its technical maturity, broad community and adaptability.

      org: Pipeline to Power, working for NYC Civic Engagement Commission
      quote: Part of what makes Decidim so powerful is that it adds a level of abstraction to the work separating out  the steps of a process and the activities associated with the process. That’s part of the information architecture, so that not only you are saying what is happening at each step but different parts of Decidim behave differently depending on when you are doing or depending on what step in the process you are in. The fact that that’s customizable really allows Decidim to be moulded to how we are doing our work and not our work to be moulded.
