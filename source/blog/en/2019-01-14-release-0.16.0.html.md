## New Features

### **Amendments**

With the Amendments feature any participant can edit the text of a proposal and a “sub-proposal” will be created as an [amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment). This amendment may gather endorsements and supports. The author of the original proposal may accept or reject the amendment. If it’s rejected, the author of the amendment may convert it into a new proposal.

* Add filter by type functionality to Amendments on proposals.[ #4567](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/4567/)

* Add version control functionality to Amendments on proposals.[ #4567](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/4567/)

* Add polymorphic Amendment feature that can be activated in the proposal component with these working functionalities: create/withdraw/accept amendments.[ #3985](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/3985/)

* Add reject/promote amendments functionalities into Amendment feature.[ #3986](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/3986/)

### **Contextual Help System**

Decidim includes now a configurable contextual help system to guide participants in the use and understanding of the platform.

On one side, the "More information" section is now called "Help" and there you can create different pages grouped by topics. There are some texts poulated by default and they can be modified and customized from the admin interface.

On the other side, in the header of each participation space a collapsible banner is shown with a brief explanation of it.

When a participant registers for the first time she receives a welcome notification with links to the help pages.

* Ability to send a welcome notification to new users[ #4432](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/4432)

* Ability to specify contextual help to participatory spaces[ #4470](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/4470)

### **Extra hashtags**

For some participatory processes we might want to allow participants to a) assign proposals to several categories, or b) search proposals by category from different participatory processes at once.

This feature defines an additional use of hashtags: extra hashtags. These are regular hashtags added to a content, but with an special character to mark them as "extra" for that particular uses. 

There are automatic and suggested hashtags. Automatic hashtags are hashtags that are assigned by default to all proposals created in a proposals component.

Suggested hashtags allow to define a set of predefined hashtags that can be offered to participants to improve organization of the proposals, also to improve global search results.

* Automatic and suggested hashtags.[ #4585](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/4585/)

* Offline: The user doesn't upload any picture, only fills the document type and number. Then visits the admin. The admin needs to fill the user email, document type and number. If all data match, the user is verified.
