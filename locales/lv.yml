        Thanks to Decidim, in Barcelona we have managed to co-produce a strategic city plan together with the citizens. In 2016 we inaugurated the Municipal Action Plan in the form of a participatory process through Decidim Barcelona. Currently, this plan includes almost 7 thousand citizen proposals. One of the advantages of using this platform is that you can monitor at all times the state of implementation of the approved proposals.

        With the implementation of Decidim in Som Energia we have generated a kinder space for participation. We released the tool in 2018, hosting the General Assembly of the Cooperative and months later we debated the Image Redesign and collaborative development of the School of Som Energia, among other participatory processes. In a few months, more than 3,500 participant people have registered, 5 participatory processes, 3 assemblies operating and more than 1,300 votes in the last General Assembly vote.

        Almost every participatory process that has come to our table, we have been able to solve it using Decidim's business rules. As a tool, it is a very strong one. However, the part that seems strongest and most important to us is its community, both developers and those who use it for participatory processes. Coexisting with them has made us appreciate the challenges involved in implementing participatory democracy in the real world.
