  In the regular decidim system, participants' accounts information such as
  their names, emails, nicknames, etc. and their activities, such as comments,
  votes, and more, are considered public. This means that anyone can search for
  users' profile information and their activities. However, this openness has
  recently raised concerns among some participants (see here for more
  information).


  To address these concerns, this module provides an additional layer of privacy to user accounts. By installing this module, users now have the option to switch their accounts to private. Furthermore, all information related to private users will be hidden from third parties, including Decidim API.
