description: A Decidim module for creating ideas in participatory budgeting. The
  base of the ideas component is extremely similar to the core proposals module
  which you should primarily use if you want to implement participatory
  budgeting as it is designed in Decidim by default. The ideas module is more
  limited in features but has a higher focus on achieving a better user
  experience for working with ideas.
