  This module is an evolution of the original IdCat mòbil.


  One of the goals of this module is to decouple the authentication method from the IdCat Mòbil and pursue a more agnostic with a registry of providers. It also implements additional user options for extended verification methods using Via Oberta (or other providers) with improved user's control over personal data management.
