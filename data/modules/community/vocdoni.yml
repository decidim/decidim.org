  Vocdoni.


  Vocdoni is a secure digital voting solution using decentralized technologies. The voting protocol which powers the platform is designed to be universally verifiable, secure, and resistant to attack and censorship through the use of blockchain technology, together with decentralized technologies and cryptographic mechanisms, such as zero-knowledge proofs.


  This will allow administrators to set-up elections in the Vocdoni blockchain (aka Vochain), using the Vocdoni SDK.
