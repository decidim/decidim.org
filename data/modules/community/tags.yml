url: https://github.com/mainio/decidim-module-tags
description: Provides the possibility to add tags to any records, e.g.
  proposals, users, results, etc. This is a technical module that adds this
  ability to Decidim but the tags functionality needs to be manually added to
  the individual models, the tags input needs to be added to the editing views
  and the tags display needs to be added to the record views. This module
  provides you all the tools to add these elements to the user interface.
