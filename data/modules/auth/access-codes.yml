description: Provides a new verification method that allows system
  administrators to define new verification workflows where the admins can
  provide access to specific users by sending them an access code. This module
  does not itself register any verification workflows because these access code
  workflows are generally specific to the system in question. For example, if
  the admins want to provide access only for specific users to add new proposals
  in a specific participatory space, they can define a new workflow for that.
