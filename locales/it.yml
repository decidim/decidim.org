      paragraph: '<h3>a. Data collected from surfing the Website</h3> <p>When using our website, <a href="%{decidim_url}">Decidim</a> uses the services of Plausible analysis software.  Its is software that, when tracking user data, this data is kept fully and securely encrypted. The purpose of Plausible Analytics is to track general traffic trends on your website and not individual visitors. Each HTTP request sends the IP address and user agent to the server, so that''s what they use, generating an identifier that changes daily using the visitor''s IP address and user agent. To anonymise this data, it is passed through a hash function with a rotating salt. This generates a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate the number of unique visitors for the day. The IP address of the raw data and the user agent are never stored in the logs, databases or anywhere on Plausible analytics disk. Older salts are deleted every 24 hours to avoid the possibility of linking visitor information from one day to the next.   In this way, no personal user data is collected while browsing our website, for more information about the data processing by Plausible Analytics, you can visit their website at <a href="https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics">https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics</a></p> <h3>b.

      org: Municipio Di Barcellona (2015-2019)
      quote: Grazie a Decidim, a Barcellona siamo riusciti a co-produrre un piano urbano strategico insieme ai cittadini. Nel 2016 abbiamo inaugurato il Piano d'azione comunale sotto forma di processo partecipativo attraverso Decidim Barcelona. Attualmente, questo piano comprende quasi 7 mila proposte dei cittadini. Uno dei vantaggi dell'utilizzo di questa piattaforma è che è possibile monitorare in ogni momento lo stato di attuazione delle proposte approvate.
    n2:
      org: Som Energia
      quote: Con la realizzazione di Decidim in Som Energia abbiamo generato uno spazio più gentile per la partecipazione. Abbiamo rilasciato lo strumento nel 2018, ospitando l'Assemblea Generale della Cooperativa e mesi più tardi abbiamo discusso la Riedizione delle Immagini e lo sviluppo collaborativo della Scuola di Som Energia, tra gli altri processi partecipativi. In pochi mesi, più di 3.500 partecipanti hanno registrato, 5 processi partecipativi, 3 assemblee funzionanti e più di 1.300 voti nell'ultimo voto dell'Assemblea generale.

      quote: La Piattaforma digitale di Decide Medi rida è stata un’opportunità che si è aperta come mai prima dei meccanismi di partecipazione dei cittadini per l’elaborazione del Piano di Sviluppo Municipale di Medi rida 2018-2021. Abbiamo avuto più di 3.000 interazioni con i cittadini tra cui proposte, commenti, suggerimenti e sostegno per raggiungere il massimo consenso possibile su ciò che è meglio per la nostra città. Indubbiamente, la piattaforma Decide Meær rida continuerà ad essere il nostro alleato nel rendere Meær rida una società sempre più partecipativa.

      quote: Quello che apprezziamo è che è costruito con la democrazia in mente e quindi la democrazia è un grande obiettivo. Principi democratici come la responsabilità, l'uguaglianza e la trasparenza sono al centro del progetto.

      org: Governo aperto di Città del Messico
      quote: Quasi ogni processo partecipativo che è venuto al nostro tavolo, siamo stati in grado di risolverlo utilizzando le regole commerciali di Decidim. Come strumento, è molto forte. Tuttavia, la parte che ci sembra più forte e più importante è la sua comunità, sia gli sviluppatori che quelli che la utilizzano per processi partecipativi. La coesistenza con loro ci ha fatto apprezzare le sfide legate all'attuazione della democrazia partecipativa nel mondo reale.
    n6:
      org: Mozilla Foundation
      quote: We suffer under a lack of public space. It's particularly important that we reclaim these public spaces for us. Open platforms such as Decidim do exactly that. Is not only that is open source so other people can fork it, reuse it and build a process. It also has these values that we want to reflect in our society encoded in the way it's designed.
    n7:
      org: OpenForum Europe Research Director, European Union
      quote: The process started in October 2019 at the European Commission’s DG Communication and eDemocracy unit at the Joint Research Centre, the European Commission's science and knowledge service. An analysis of the needs of the Conference and which tools fit those, lead to choosing the open source tool Decidim for its technical maturity, broad community and adaptability.
    n8:
      org: Pipeline to Power, working for NYC Civic Engagement Commission
      quote: Part of what makes Decidim so powerful is that it adds a level of abstraction to the work separating out  the steps of a process and the activities associated with the process. That’s part of the information architecture, so that not only you are saying what is happening at each step but different parts of Decidim behave differently depending on when you are doing or depending on what step in the process you are in. The fact that that’s customizable really allows Decidim to be moulded to how we are doing our work and not our work to be moulded.
