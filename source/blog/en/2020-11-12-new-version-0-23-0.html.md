## Improvements to existing features

### System

Maps and geocoding are now fully configurable, and there’s a standardized API to plug any possible service to the map functionality in Decidim: dynamic maps, static maps, geocoding and geocoding autocompletion (e.g. proposals and meetings).

Also we have improved the overall security and accessibility by allowing system administrators to configure the allowed file extensions, allowed MIME types and maximum file upload sizes on the organization level.

* Make maps actually configurable [\#6340](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6340)
* Make file upload settings configurable [\#6377](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/6377)
* Move OAUTH Application management to system panel [\#5955](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/5955)

### Admin

Two features have been added that will be very useful for any administrator. The first is the ability to share unpublished components with a system of expirable tokens.  The second one allows to create questionnaire templates which can be managed and used whenever a questionnaire is created.
