description: "Allow admins to create url aliases for resources within a
  Decidim::ParticipatorySpace. The module is based on the Redirector gem and
  creates an interface for admins to manage redirect rules. Redirect rules have
  two parts: the source defines how to match the incoming request path and the
  destination is where to send the visitor if the match is made."
