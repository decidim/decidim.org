### Design

* Added a content blocks management system for the homepage. The basic idea is that in the admin we can reorder all of the blocks in the home (we already can de-activate them, as well as customize some of them). We could show two columns: one for the active ones, and the other for the de-activated ones.[ #3839](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/3839)
