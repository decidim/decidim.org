### Usability improvements

* **Admin**: The administration panel of proposals allows to sort by the different columns. [#2419](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2419)
* **Editing proposals**: Proposals can not only be edited for a certain period of time, but can now also be withdrawn as long as they have not received any support [#2289](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/2289). The withdrawn proposals are not deleted, they appear in the list of "Withdrawn proposals" without their author's information.
* **Newsletter**: The Newsletter has been improved by adding a link that allows you to unsubscribe and the option to view it in your browser. UTM GET codes have also been added to maintain click traceability and better monitor analytics. [#2359](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2359)
* **Comments**: The comment counters have been modified, so the statistics reflect comments from all levels, not just those at the top level. [#2551](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2551)
* **Scroll from the Components menu**: The horizontal *scroll* displayed in the navigation bar has been removed. [#2495](https://gitHub.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2495)
* **Default notifications**: Notifications are enabled by default. Participants can disable them from the same email that warns about new notifications. [#2517](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2517)
* **Conversations**: The list of conversations is sorted in ascending order by the most recent conversations. On the other hand, the thread of messages within a conversation is ordered chronologically (the last ones are published at the end). [#2520](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2520)

### Bug fixing

* **Accountability**: The average percentage is calculated taking into account all items. [#2638](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2638)
* **Conversations**
    * Conversations of a participant with herself are not allowed. [#2630](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2630)
    * Duplicate threads with the same participant are not allowed. [#2376](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2376)
    * Conversations can now be accessed from mobile devices. [#2364](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2364)
* **Redirecting login**: [#2321](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2321) [#2504](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/2504) Links or buttons that require previous login can be accessed now. Once logged in, you are redirected to the initial URL, avoiding losing context.
