  The EnhancedTextwork module allows users to contribute to participatory
  textwork. They can support text-paragraphs, amend them, comment on them and
  discuss among each other.


  This module is based on decidim-proposals and was developed to improve the existing participatory_texts functionality to better suit specific needs for participatory textwork.
