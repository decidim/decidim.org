## Release Highlights

### **One time participation**

This version introduces a game-changer for occasional participants, those who engage just once (e.g., to vote in a budget process) but face friction with traditional registration. The new ephemeral verification method lets users verify their identity without creating an account, reducing drop-offs and boosting participation. Admins can enable this feature per component, linking it to existing verification systems (like a census), while ensuring data privacy and minimizing conflicts.

* Standardize direct verification for one-time participation [\#13579](https://github.com/decidim/decidim/pull/13579)

### **Taxonomies for better content organization**

Decidim 0.30 unifies and upgrades how content is classified across the platform. Previously, scopes, areas, and categories worked in isolation—now, taxonomies bring them together into a single, customizable system. Admins can build hierarchical structures tailored to their needs (e.g., "Environment > Mobility > Cycling") and apply them across components. This makes content easier to organize, navigate, and filter—whether you're running a city-wide consultation or a small community process.

### **Add proposal coauthors from comments**

Collaboration gets easier with the ability to add coauthors directly from the proposal comments. When participants suggest improvements or contribute meaningfully to the discussion, proposal authors can now recognize their input by adding them as coauthors, highlighting collective building in the democratic processes.

### **AI for spam prevention**

Moderating spam and low-quality content is a recurring challenge in Decidim installations. This feature it's a first stepping stone to have a way of improving the detection and automated flag of spam, and also marks the beginning of a responsible integration of AI to support democratic infrastructure.
